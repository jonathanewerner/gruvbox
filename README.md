# semantic-highlight-base-colorscheme
This is my personal base vim colorscheme for usage with the [semantic-highlight](https://github.com/jaxbot/semantic-highlight.vim) plugin.

I mostly code javascript and the basic idea of this colorscheme is to de-colorize all the stuff thats normally colorized (`if`, `else`, `var`) etc and only colorize the variable names with the `semantic-highlight` plugin.

Its totally a WIP and i'll keep adjusting it to fit my personal taste. :)
